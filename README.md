# townmunculus

*Currently just an idea*

When talking to or hearing from city and town managers at conferences---also,
generally, when prospecting in this space---I'm constantly Googling: "Where is
this town? What's its population?" to get context about how the jurisdiction
fits into the world. I want a homunculus in my browser that helps me with this.

The goal is to get vital statistics of U.S. towns with minimal keystrokes.
Minimally, a typeahead would get me its population within a handful of
keystrokes. Fancier would be to show a quick map so I also have a sense of
geography. Such a tool would be internally useful at conferences and related
venues, a valuable learning project to expose me to client-side web
development, and (if nicely buttoned up) a fun party favor for localgov
conferences.
